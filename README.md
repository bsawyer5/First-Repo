## About me

I'm a first year BME Masters student, with a focus area of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.
I have nearly no coding experience, and have not done advanced math in years, so this should be fun.

What I *do* have is:

1. A willingness to not waste tuition money.
2. Finite but not altogether suboptimal intelligence.
3. The ability to laugh when everything is collapsing around me, also known as hysteria.
